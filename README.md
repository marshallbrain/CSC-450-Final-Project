# CSC-450 Final Project

---

## About
For our final project in CSC-450, me and my group were tasked with creating an application that used a database in some capacity and going through all of the steps that a professionally made application would go through. To achieve this, we created a warehouse management application that used SQLite to allow someone to see the current inventory of a warehouse as well as track inbound and outbound shipments.

## Key Learnings
- SQLite
- Agile
